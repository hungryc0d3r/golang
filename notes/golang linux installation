============Installing Golang from repository============


<-----kali linux----->

==> sudo apt-get install -y golang

After the installation process is done we need to configure a little bit in our .bashrc file

==> sudo mousepad ~/.bashrc

Then we paste these following paths at the end of .bashrc file

# Golang paths in bashrc
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$GOROOT/bin:$PATH

Then we save and close .bashrc file.

==> source .bashrc
